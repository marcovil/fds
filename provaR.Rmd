## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
typeof(mpg)

mpg

my_tibble <- 
  tibble(
  x = c(1, 9, 5),
  y = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
  z = c("apple", "pear", "banana")
)

my_tibble[["x"]]
names(my_tibble)
```

```{r}
#funzione anonima che viene anche chiamata
(function(x)x+7+8)(4)
```
